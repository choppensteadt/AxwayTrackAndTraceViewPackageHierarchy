Description
This App extends Axway Track & Trace.  It provides the functionality to scan an EPCIS barcode on a container and determine whatâ€™s in it with as many levels of aggregation as required (i.e. bottle in a tray, tray in a box, box in a shipper, etc).  At the lowest saleable level, the app runs a serial number verification to ensure authenticity.
